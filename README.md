# RLG.r3_CANASUViGHi (Canas Uvighi)

A third revisit of my RogueLike/RPG Game project.

I have omitted the sprite tiles used for the game in order to keep the repository cleaner.
You can download the full pack of tiles (which are under the CC0 License) I am currently using for the game development from
    http://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-crawl-32x32-tiles
In order to build the project, unzip the folder "tiles/" in the project folder "Content/".

Unless otherwise noted the source files are under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3
(a copy of which is provided in the project, see LICENSE.txt).
