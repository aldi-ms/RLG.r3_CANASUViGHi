* First commit of the started before several days project based on
an older project -MonoGame_RLG.Revival-CANASUViGHi.

* Implemented IEnumerable<T> for the PriorityQueue class, to iterate
over the contained actor list.

* Implemented the class PriorityQueue for objects implementing IActor 
in the GameEngine, to keep track of all actors on the map, and giving 
them option to act according to their energy value. [Turn system]

* Added method PushKey(Keys key) to the KeyboardBuffer class, to
return keys that were not processed currently, otherwise they are lost.

* Added property int MovementCost to ITerrain, to show the cost for 
moving into a certain terrain type.

* Added class MonsterSprites to keep all loaded monster sprites, and
created a reference to it in the Sprite class.

* Return type of method Move(CardinalDirection direction) in IActor
 changed to int, to show the cost of the move made. Returns 0 if the
 move was unsuccessful.

* Creating a object of type Actor now automatically raises the 
Flag.IsBlocked for the Actor created.
