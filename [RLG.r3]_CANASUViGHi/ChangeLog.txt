* The MessageLog now works as expected; splits too long string to
 several rows, and uses in-string code to denote a specifically
  colored letter/word/string (check Models/ColorMessages.txt for 
  more details.)

* Created an interface IMessageLog to use to draw and keep string
 messages. class MessageLog now implements the interface.

* First commit of the started before several days project based on
 an older project -MonoGame_RLG.Revival-CANASUViGHi.

* Implemented IEnumerable<T> for the PriorityQueue class, to iterate
 over the contained actor list.

* Implemented the class PriorityQueue for objects implementing IActor 
 in the GameEngine, to keep track of all actors on the map, and giving 
 them option to act according to their energy value. [Turn system]

* Added method PushKey(Keys key) to the KeyboardBuffer class, to
 return keys that were not processed currently, otherwise they are lost.

* Added property int MovementCost to ITerrain, to show the cost for 
 moving into a certain terrain type.

* Added class MonsterSprites to keep all loaded monster sprites, and
 created a reference to it in the Sprite class.

* Return type of method Move(CardinalDirection direction) in IActor
 changed to int, to show the cost of the move made. Returns 0 if the
 move was unsuccessful.

* Creating a object of type Actor now automatically raises the 
 Flag.IsBlocked for the Actor created.

* Implemented Field of View calculation for the Map.
	- Spawning NPCs do not work for some reason. -
	+ Issue was incorrectly assigning and keeping Flags to a Tile in
	which a Actor has been. Working correctly now by clearing the Tile
	Flags we do not need. +
