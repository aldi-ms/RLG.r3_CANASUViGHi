* To draw a string/part of a string in a specific color use:


~[select_char][color_UInt]!	- formatting sequence in string passed to FormatWriteOnPosition.


-->	'~'						- denotes the beggining of a format sequence.


-->	[select_char]			- selects the size/length of text to colour (case-insensitive). ->
	L - selects the next letter from the string.
	W - selects the next word.
	S - selects the rest of the string.


-->	[color_UInt]			- selects the color in which the string will be shown. ->
	Use Color.ToUInt() to get the UInt representation of a XNA Color.
	To parse the UInt to color use UInt.ToColor() (both methods are located inside 
	Framework.ColorExtensions).


-->	'!'						- denotes end of sequence.
