Guidelines for using colors in the Message Log.

To draw a string/part of a string in a specific color use:

~[select char][color]!	- formatting sequence in string passed to FormatWriteOnPosition.

-->	'~'					- denotes the beggining of a format sequence.

-->	[select char]		- selects the size/length of text to colour (case-insensitive). ->
	L - selects the next letter from the string.
	W - selects the next word.
	S - selects the rest of the string.

-->	[color]				- selects the color in which the string will be shown. ->
	use Framework.ColorExtensions Color.ToUInt() to get the uint representation of a XNA Color
	to parse the uint to color use the extension UInt.ToColor().

-->	'!'					- end of seq.
